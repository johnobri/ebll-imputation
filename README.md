# ebll-imputation

This Jupyter Notebook is intended to explore NYS's EBLL dataset with
the goal of using Scikit-learn's Iterative Imputer to fill null values
based on features drawn from the Census's 2014-2019 5-Year Estimates.
The feature set selection continues to be a work in progress.

A 2021 copy of the EBLL dataset has been uploaded to this repository.
Official 2019 statistics of new EBLL cases by County can be found here:
